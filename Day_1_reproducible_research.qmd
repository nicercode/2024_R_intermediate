# Sesssion 1: 

- before class: installation issues
- Outline of course, logistics, housekeeping
- The big vision of the course: a workflow for reproducible research (today) and techniques scaling up you computations (tomorrow)
  - By the end of course, collaboratively built course notes and reproducible analyses, using new techniques
  - Starting example:
    - Download repro, example (zip)
    - We're going to build on this!
      - The data: Penguins! 
      - Scaling up challenges   
  
  - Activity: Identify challenges for reproducible research
  - Goals: 
    1. reproducibility for a) Yourself, b) Your collaborator (supervisor), c).Stranger publication
    2. Enjoy coding! Feeling in control. Start and stop projects. Collaboration. Effivient computations

  - Brainstorm of challenges
    - break into groups of 3-4
    - Part 1: identify 3 challenges/problems for reproducibility (share around the group)
    - Part 2: go deeper on 1 issue, including possible solutions


# Session 2:   Collaboration and Version control with Git & Github

  goals: 
  
  1. fork class repro, start contributing via a PR
    - add a file with a short bio in a etx file
  2. start your own repro with your group
    - start adding stuff and suncing across computers
    - maybe handle a conflict

# Sessions 3-4: Technqiues for Reproducible Research 

13:30-16:00

  - Goal: shared notes on how to solve (in github repo)
    - demonstrators set up headings, then fill in as we go
  - Voting: prioritise challenges for reporoducibility

## Organisation
   
- directory, folder structure: data, outputs
- Rstudio projects
- Rmd/R/Qmq

## Reproducible code

    - Goal: rerun all the time
      - traps: premature optimisation, broken code, package updates, rversion, reproducibility, slow compute (cluster), manual steps
      - DRY. Why? future changes, resuse:  avoid lots of cut and paste (functions tomororw)

    - Rmd/R/Qmq
 Maintaining clean, working code 
 - Clean accessible code
  - clean master script 
  - version control


## Saving outputs

figures: 
    - ggsave, sepcify sizes, code it
    - formats: pdf vs png

Redering docs
  - render docs: suppmat or reports
    - point & click vs coded
    - can format nicely

## Optimise Rstudio setup

no caching, outputs to console, don't save env

## collaboration - github
   
## R environment

- document packages
- renv
