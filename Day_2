# Introduction

The goal of this session is to collaboratively solve a series of challenges that will introduce you to practices that enable you scale up your computations. Topics that challenges will cover involve: 

- tidy data: tidyr pivot longer / pivot wider
- dplyr: join, group_by
- map, nest
- Functions
    - types: anonymous, named
    - when we use functions
    - map workflows
    - Nest workflow
- longer functions

## Load libraries

We will primarily be using packages from the {tidyverse}, feel free to add more packages here to help solve the challenges.
```{r}
libary(tidyverse)
```


## Challenge 1

We have just returned from an expedition from Anatarcia and collected *a lot* of data from multiple species of penguins. We recorded data for each species in seperate `.csv` files but we need to combine these into one large dataframe for analyses. How can we do this programmatically? 

```{r, challenge-1-learner-solutions}

```


```{r, challenge-1-instructor-solutions}
data <- list.files("lessons/data/penguins/", full.names = TRUE) |> 
  map_df(read_csv, show_col_types = FALSE)
```
